   </h1>
 </div>

 <p> Hello! My name is Hailey Robbins, and I am currently a Sophmore/Junior at Northern Kentucky University. I graduated from Carroll County High School in 2021 where I was Top 20 in my class and was a dual credit student at the Jefferson Community and Technical College Carrollton Campus for five semesters. Outside of my academics in high school, I was involved with concert band for seven years, marching band for seven years, woodwind section leader for a year, and a delegate for Carroll County at the Kentucky United Nations Association for five years. After I graduated high school, I attended Georgetown College for a semester and then transfered to NKU. During my college career, I have been on the Dean's/President's List for 4 semesters. In March 2021, I started my first job as a Chiropractic Assistant and worked there until I went off to college in August 2021. </p>

 <p> Outside of my academics and professional life, there are some important personal facts about me as well. I am 20 years old and my hometown is Carrollton, KY. I have a small immediate family, but a very large extended family. Ever since I was a child, my family and I would volunteer at various places. We have volunteered at places in our community and traveled to different states to volunteer. Some places I have volunteered are our local food pantry, a women's shelter in Alaska, helping after the Gatlinburg wildfires, the Out of the Darkness walk, etc. In my free time, I enjoy reading, watching true crime documentaries, playing with my dog, and spending time with my family and friends. </p>
